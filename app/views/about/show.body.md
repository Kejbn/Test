### Empowering the developer

I've been an independent developer for the past two years. And leads are rarely consistent. Sometimes I can barely keep up with the work and other times I struggle to find my next gig.

And job boards are rarely helpful for freelance and contract work. They are mostly focused on full-time roles.

railsdevs.io strives to give power back to the independent developer. Instead of companies posting their jobs, developers post their profiles. That way, the power dynamic is reversed as companies have to reach out to developers first.

### Doing everything in public

railsdevs.io is [open source](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.io/), the [analytics are publicly available](https://app.usefathom.com/share/cacnfaan/railsdevs.io), and [bug reports are shared freely](https://app.honeybadger.io/project/EKRGgkQdR0).

On top of that, I'm making all of my decisions in public. I post questions and ideas when I'm looking for feedback on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.io/discussions). And I tweet about work in progress (and sneak previews) [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti).

### Creating a safe, inclusive environment

The site is open to all Ruby on Rails developers, regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or skill level.

If there's something that doesn't feel right, or you don't feel comfortable, please [send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) right away.
