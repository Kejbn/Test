# Redesign

Notes as [the redesign](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/milestone/5) gets implemented.

## Assumptions made

* There was no active styling given for the mobile menu items. I've opted for them to not be full width so that they match the desktop styles

## Fixes needed

* Medium-sized buttons use 12px of padding instead of 16px
* I've increased the spacing between mobile menu items so that the active state is more clear
* On the pricing page, the space between the bottom of the hero needed to be a bit larger than shown on Figma to look correct
* Font Awesome icons were used in the mockups, so I had to use slightly different icons on the pricing page
* The line height on the feature descriptions was as given in Figma looked too tight when translated to the browser. I loosened it up to be a tad more spacious
* Plan description needed a tad more line-height. leading-8 -> leading-9
